<!--#### Non-optional (required) tags -->

<!--
	The ID is the only required meta-information for a fragment.
	It can be an arbitrary string and must be unique across all
	fragments.
-->
<meta name="id" content="unique-fragment-id" />



<!-- #### Optional tags below  -->

<!--
	The mime-type (if supplied) can be 'html', 'css', 'js' or 'text'.
	This influences how the content will be trusted.
-->
<meta name="mime" content="html" />

<!--
	If this tag is present, the whole fragment will be embedded into
	the content.json rather than loading it at runtime with a separate
	request. You may do this for very tiny fragments.
-->
<meta name="embed" />

<fragment>
	<!--
		The actual content of the fragment. This can be anything ranging
		from plain text over Html to JavaScript or Css. Xml or base64-
		encoded images would be possible as well.
	-->
</fragment>
