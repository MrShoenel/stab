<!--#### Non-optional (required) tags -->
<!--
	Date.parse() compatible date or 'auto' if you want to have
	it generated by looking at the file's last modification time.
	This meta-tag will be put into the document's head.
-->
<meta name="lastmodified" content="2015-05-15 19:00" />
<!--
	The article's name is required as well. If you do not
	provide a name this file's name will be used.
-->
<meta name="title" content="My Article" />
<!--
	We're also gonna use that as the article's ID. You
	might leave the URL empty so it will get auto-generated
	from the title, but be careful: If the title changes, so
	will the URL (think of SEO).
	The URL may also contain an arbitrary relative path that
	can be used then for organizing articles into categories.
-->
<meta name="urlname" content="my-category/some-fancy-url-name" />




<!-- #### Optional/arbitrary tags below  -->
<!--
	Now the following tags are fully arbitrary and depend on
	your needs or wheter your template makes any use of them.
-->
<meta name="subtitle" content="My Article's sub-title" />

<!--
	If present, the next tags will be used 1-to-1 in the
	head-section of the current document:
-->
<meta name="author" content="Author's name'">
<meta name="copyright" content="(c) ME" />
<meta name="description" content="Meta description for article" />
<meta name="keywords" content="blog, git" />

<!-- Useful for tagging articles: -->
<meta name="displayat" content="default" />
<!-- Used to override the designated background image: -->
<meta name="bgimage" content="images/contact-bg.jpg" />


<article>
	<!--
			This is the default article that you may use as template.
			The default article will not be put into content.json.
			Use any styles from the included CSS files. If you configure
			stab to allow angular-flavored html, you may use it here as well.
