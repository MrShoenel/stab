<!-- Non-optional (required) tags -->
<!--
	Date.parse() compatible date or 'auto' if you want
	to have it generated by looking at the file's last
	modification time.
-->
<meta name="lastmodified" content="2015-05-15 19:00" />
<!--
	The article's name is required as well. If you do not
	provide a name this file's name will be used.
-->
<meta name="title" content="My Article" />
<!--
	We're also gonna use that as the article's ID. You
	might leave the URL empty so it will get auto-generated
	from the title, but be careful: If the title changes, so
	will the URL (think of SEO).
	The URL may also contain an arbitrary relative path that
	can be used then for organizing articles into categories.
-->
<meta name="urlname" content="my-category/some-fancy-url-name" />
